once upon a time in dairy

(long before they made their butter)

there was once a young fairy

(once, yes, but not last)

she waited and longed for her wings to flutter

(she wanted to fly so high she could go back to the past)

no one told her the past was not *up*

(for up only meant beyond)

for they knew not the truth of the stars themselves

(of too much exploration, dairy fairies, were not particularly fond)

but her wings were not yet grown

(her neighbors oft thought she'd be better suited 'mongst elves)

nor were her feet leather-soled;

so young belinda, the wingless dairy fairy,

expanded her mind as her time ticked forward

as her body but not her heart grew old

though her wings never took her to the past

neither did the judgements of the others long last

for of them all, the dairy fairies ne'er grew bold

(little did she know, her tale was but a fore-ward,

a prologue, of a tail still to tell

for the though the past ne'er knew of her face

the bright future knew her all so well)
